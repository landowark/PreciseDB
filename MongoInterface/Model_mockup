So the way that a patient model should be structured is:

Patient Object:
    - Patient Number
    - tScore
    - DRE
    - PSAs (keyed by date)
    - procedures (biopsies, keyed by date)
    - status
    - treatments
    - filters = {Filter Object (keyed by filter number):
        - AC Ratio
        - CTC Number (if scanned)
        - Date Received
        - max telomere intensity
        - mean telomere intensity
        - mean nuclear Diameter
        - mean nuclear Volume
        - mean number of Signals per cell
        - percentage of signals in 1st quarter of intensity
        - percentage of signals in 2nd quarter of intensity
        - percentage of signals in 3rd quarter of intensity
        - percentage of signals in 4th quarter of intensity
        - peak Number of Signals in a cell
        - percentage of signals that are Aggregates
        - mean percent Distance of signal from nuclear center
        - mean number of signals Per nuclear Volume unit
        - time Point
        - images = { Image Objects (keyed by image number):
            - AC Ratio
            - nuclear Diameter
            - nuclear Volume
            - max telomere intensity
            - mean telomere intensity (normal)
            - mean telomere intensity (aggregates)
            - percentage of signals that are Aggregates
            - mean percent Distance of signal from nuclear center
            - number of signals
            - number of signals Per nuclear Volume unit
            - nuclear center X axis
            - nuclear center Y axis
            - nuclear center Z axis
            - telomeres = { Telomere Objects (keyed by number):
                X position: 100,
                Y position: 91,
                Z position: 93,
                Is an aggregate (boolean): 0,
                percent dist from nuclear center
                intensity
                distance from x axis centre
                distance from y axis centre
                distance from z axis centre
                }
            }
        }
